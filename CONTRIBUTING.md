Contributing
============

If you're reading this, you're probably in fire/EMS, and likely understand the importance of a volunteer community. This project started a couple of years ago when I got tired of typing the same phrases over and over (I _hate_ trip sheets) - but I've moved out of state and work in tech, so I don't use emscharts or the extension anymore. While I plan to support the project technically, I don't use it anymore, so it's kinda impossible to discover bugs or suggest improvements. 

While the project has been on GitHub since Day 1, I've recently made it an organization with [@jhaisley](https://github.com/jhaisley) and [kzky74](https://github.com/kzky74). As [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) software, the direction of the project is up to the community. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document itself in a pull request. So, if you're considering contributing, TYFYS.

#### Reporting Bugs

If you notice something not working, or not working as you believe it should, it might be a bug

To report an issue:
 - From the "Issues" tab, click the green "New Issue" button, then select "Bug Report"
 - You'll be taken to a screen with a [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) template that's a kind of SAMPLE survey for the bug (to help us understand and triage it)
 - In Chrome, you can see debug information and specific errors by pressing `F12`, or by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" from the context menu. The "Console" tab may contain useful information
 - Please attach screenshots (if applicable). 
 
#### Suggesting Features
 
 If you'd like to suggest a feature/improvement/change in functionality, follow the steps for "Reporting Bugs", but select the "Feature Request" template instead. 
 
#### Testing
 
 - Alpha Releases - We haven't enabled an alpha release channel yet, but you will be able to opt-in by (TBD)
 - Bug Verification - If you see a bug reported, it's helpful to know exactly under what conditions it occurs, if it affects all devices/versions, just one type of device/version, etc. 
 - Sometimes, the user is the problem, and verifying that a bug *doesn't* exist can be helpful to both users and developers
 
#### Contributing Code
 
 See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for instructions on getting started as a developer
 
#### Pull Requests

The preferred way to make a pull request is via forks and branches, but small edits can be done in the web interface. If you see a typo, confusing wording, or missing information, you can click "edit" on the file and make changes.

When saving, do not "commit directly to the `master` branch" - always "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"


#### Adding Documentation

If you came here looking for information about Chartfiller, but found it elsewhere, or figured it out yourself, other people will probably have the same question. Consider editing the "Wiki" tab to add end-user documentation.
