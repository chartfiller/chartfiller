Contributing
============

If you're reading this, you're probably in fire/EMS, and likely understand the importance of a volunteer community. This project started a couple of years ago when I got tired of typing the same phrases over and over (I _hate_ trip sheets) - but I've moved out of state and work in tech, so I don't use emscharts or the extension anymore. While I plan to support the project technically, I don't use it anymore, so it's kinda impossible to discover bugs or suggest improvements. 

While the project has been on GitHub since Day 1, I've recently made it an organization with [@jhaisley](https://github.com/jhaisley) and [](). As [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) software, the direction of the project is up to the community. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document itself in a pull request. So, if you're considering contributing, TYFYS.
